		<p>You decide to run away. In the distance you hear a car. Its headlights are getting closer. You take a left turn 
		into a dark alleyway and end up behind a small boat house. You see the car speed past you and you decide to flank it.
		<br>You run onto the main road and lose it. It only took you ten minutes to find the police station nearest to you. 
		<br>Once you arrive you quickly tell your story. Thirty minutes later the police sergeant returns looking happy with 
		himself. He tells you that you were the bait in a drug bust and now you are a key person in the crime of the year.
		<br><br>THE END</p>
